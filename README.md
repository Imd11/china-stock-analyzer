## Tech Stack üõ†

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **AI Model**: GPT-5-thinking-all via Tu-zi API
- **Proxy Server**: Node.js + Express + Axios
- **Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Installation üì¶

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Imd11/china-stock-analyzer.git
cd china-stock-analyzer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Start the proxy server (in a new terminal):
```bash
npm run proxy-axios
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

## Scripts üìú

- `npm run dev` - Start the frontend development server
- `npm run proxy` - Start the basic proxy server
- `npm run proxy-stream` - Start the streaming proxy server
- `npm run proxy-axios` - Start the Axios-based streaming proxy server (recommended)

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The application uses the Tu-zi API for GPT-5-thinking-all model access.

Two integration modes are supported:
- Secure proxy/server (recommended): Frontend calls `/api/chat` (Vercel) or local proxy; API key lives in env vars.
- Direct client call (not recommended): Enable `USE_DIRECT_API` in `script-thinking.js` or `script-stream.js` and set `DIRECT_API_KEY`. This exposes the key to all users and may incur abuse and cost. CORS must be allowed by the API provider. The code will auto-fallback to `/api/chat` if direct call fails.

## Features in Detail üîç

## Development üíª

### Adding New Features
1. Modify the prompt template in `script-thinking.js`
2. Update styles in `style-thinking.css`
3. Test with the development server

### API Integration
The proxy server handles CORS and streaming from the Tu-zi API. Modify `proxy-server-axios.js` for API changes.

## Deployment üöÄ

### Vercel Deployment
The project is configured for easy deployment on Vercel:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Deploy with default settings

### Environment Variables
Set these in your local `.env` and in Vercel Project Settings > Environment Variables:
- `TUZI_API_KEY`: Your Tu-zi API key (required)
- `TUZI_API_URL` (optional): Defaults to `https://api.tu-zi.com/v1/chat/completions`

Security note: No API key is kept in frontend code; all calls route through a proxy or the Vercel `api/chat` serverless function which reads keys from env.
